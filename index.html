I graduated from the University of Minnesota, Morris. I started my career as a technical writer for Prudential Insurance in Plymouth. After the project ended I moved on to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage in the Government Insurance Department. Serving as an analyst and trainer. I served as the SME for the creation of a SQL system for tracking all of the departmental processes. Creating tracking, reporting and automation. After mortgage insurance I moved on to my role as a business systems consultant in Wells Fargo Customer Service. There I worked on system changes for multiple platforms. Writing BRDs, FSDs, gathering requirements, partnering with developers and testing.</p>
            <p>My interests include cycling, skiing, golfing and watching sports. I would like to travel more and enjoy regional food culture.</p>
